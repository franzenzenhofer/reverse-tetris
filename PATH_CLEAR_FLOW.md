# Path Clear Flow - Expected Behavior

## What SHOULD happen after a path is cleared:

1. **Path Detection** (IMMEDIATE)
   - User removes a piece OR line gets completed by falling pieces
   - System checks for complete horizontal lines
   - System checks for left-to-right paths
   - If found, trigger LINE_CLEARED event

2. **Board Update** (IMMEDIATE - NO WAITING!)
   - Remove all cells in the cleared paths from board
   - Update piece objects to remove cleared cells
   - Delete pieces that have no cells left
   - **CRITICAL**: Pieces can become DECOUPLED if cells are removed!

3. **Shape Decoupling** (AUTOMATIC)
   - When cells are removed from a piece, check if remaining cells are still connected
   - If not connected, split into separate pieces
   - Each new piece falls independently

4. **Gravity Application** (AUTOMATIC - NO USER INPUT NEEDED!)
   - All pieces above cleared cells should fall
   - Decoupled pieces fall separately
   - Continue falling until they hit bottom or other pieces

5. **Cascade Check** (AUTOMATIC)
   - After gravity settles, check for new line clears
   - If new clears found, repeat from step 2
   - This creates CASCADE EFFECTS automatically

6. **Visual Feedback** (PARALLEL - NON-BLOCKING)
   - Animations run in background
   - Game logic continues without waiting
   - Player sees smooth transitions

## The game MUST:
- **NEVER STOP** after clearing a line
- **NEVER WAIT** for user input after clearing
- **AUTOMATICALLY PROGRESS** through cascades
- **HANDLE DECOUPLED SHAPES** by splitting them

## Current Problem - Root Cause Analysis:

1. **state.animating flag** - Might be blocking input
2. **Missing piece decoupling logic** - Shapes don't split when cells are removed
3. **Synchronous animations** - Might be blocking the game loop
4. **Missing automatic progression** - Game waits instead of continuing

Let me analyze the code...
